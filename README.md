# Apples üçè and Tomatoes üçÖ Classifier ü§ñ

### This project was developed for my final requirements on CPE 019 (Emerging Technologies 2). 

### The main function of this Web Application was to classify whether a uploaded image was Apple or Tomato.

## Problem
Apple and Tomato has similaries in their physical properties. The followings are the most common similaries of Apples and Tomatoes:

**Shape:** Both apples and tomatoes have a round shape, although there can be variations. Some apples may be slightly more elongated or have a more pronounced taper at the base, while tomatoes can be round or slightly oblong depending on the variety.

**Size:** Both fruits come in various sizes, ranging from small to medium-sized. There are smaller varieties of apples and tomatoes, as well as larger ones, offering a range of options for different preferences and culinary uses.

**Skin Texture:** Both apples and tomatoes have a smooth and relatively thin outer skin. However, the texture of the skin differs between the two fruits. Apple skin is typically firmer and can be waxier, while tomato skin is softer and more delicate.

**Internal Structure:** Both fruits have a similar internal structure consisting of flesh, seeds, and a core. However, the texture and arrangement of these components differ. Apple flesh is crisp and firm, while tomato flesh is juicy and soft. Apples have a central core that houses the seeds, whereas tomato seeds are distributed throughout the fruit's interior.

**Edible Portion:** In both apples and tomatoes, the edible portion is primarily the flesh and the seeds (although tomato seeds are often removed in culinary applications). The skin of both fruits is also edible, although some people may choose to peel the skin off apples depending on personal preference or recipe requirements.

## Solution

I developed a Deep learning image classifier using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to automate classifying an apple and tomato based on their image (physical properties). I used Streamlit a free and open-source framework to deploy my model online.
